Golangci supports the following linters: https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters

Go Linter requires golangci installed as a binary â€“ brew install golangci/tap/golangci-lint

You may write your own configuration files: https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/


In the previous example, there were unused variables (x, p, resp) that caused compiler errors. Many linters, including golangci-lint, may stop execution if they encounter compiler errors. This is because some linters require a valid AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to perform their analysis, and compiler errors prevent the AST from being fully constructed.
